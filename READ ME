############LTM CAT doesn't shoot an error when its fed non-binary data of incorrect length#############################


This repository adds three functions to catSurv and updates one function.

The first function is catPlot which takes in a catObject, an item number, and a plot type and returns a plot of the output.
  +It uses the plot function, fisherInfo, and probability

The second function is makeTree  takes a catObject and generates a tree of all possible question-answer combinations, conditional on previous answers in the branching scheme and the current theta estimates for the branch. The tree is stored as a list of lists, iteratively generated by filling in a possible answer, calculating the next question via selectItem, filling in a possible answer for that question, and so forth.The length of each complete branching scheme within the tree is dictated by the lengthThreshold slot within the catObject.
  +It uses selectItem and lengthThreshold

The next function is theta_basic. It takes in a a set of answers and a catObj and returns a single catObj.
  +It uses apply, selectItem
  
The final function is allEst which allows users to look at data computed before \code{cat} technologies were availabe and and analyze multpile types of analyses on mulptile resondents to achieve a theta estimate.
  +It uses theta_basic
