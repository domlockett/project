##New project

# Get data from YouGov and Qualtrics
  # Fit these responses to grm objects
# Using *example.R* compare how the adaptive batt compares to fixed
# Walk simulated and real respondents through methods
## Start with big 5 on YouGov
    #randomly sample 0f 50,000 yougov and fb data
    #100 questions about 20 questions per trati, 5 traits.
      #that means five different cat objs


#Parse out which questions belong to which trait





###Jacob no fixed so just plot the adaptive
# compare to simulate
